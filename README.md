## 🧑‍💻 About

This site showcases my background, skills, and projects as a software developer. It's designed to be clean, responsive, and easy to navigate.

The site is built using the **Dimension** template by [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/dimension), with extensive customizations made to both the HTML and CSS to suit my personal style and needs.
